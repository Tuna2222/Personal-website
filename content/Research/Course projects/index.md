## COMP SCI 839

### A survey on gradient-based methods: Escaping from saddle points

<!-- Two optimization projects are done in IOE-511/MATH-562 and STATS-606. The first one is an overall investigation of many unconstrained methods companied with an exploration of other two line search methods. The second one is a review of unconstrained methods for escaping saddle points. -->
